# 🧠 RAG Document Q&A With Groq And Lama3

This project is a document-based Question & Answer chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers from two of the most cited research papers in the AI field:
- “Attention Is All You Need”
- “A Comprehensive Overview of Large Language Models”

Built using Groq-powered LLaMA3 via Ollama, the system scrapes and indexes these papers, then allows users to ask questions and receive contextually grounded answers extracted directly from the source material.
